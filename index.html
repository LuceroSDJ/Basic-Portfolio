        <p>I have to admit I have a pretty long name, and I love it! Some people call me by my first name or last name, but I prefer Lucero. It means light, and it is a synonym of star in Spanish. Honestly, I would love to literally see my name shining on a billboard sign. Just like a star! I have long way to go, but hey, life is long!</p>
        <p>I am a future in-demand web developer, who is currently equipping herself with a solid education and hands on training offered by Trilogy in partnership with UT Austin, to join the Tech industry in the near future. Currently, I am a part of the awesome team at Biryani & Co. I work full-time in their human resources and customer service departments.</p>
        <p>I am a very optimistic person, yet I am realistic and hard working.
